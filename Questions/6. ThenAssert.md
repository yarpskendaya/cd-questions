# Then/Assert Questions

- If the output you assert on is affected by input you'd rather leave out of the test, how do you deal with this?
    Example: serializing a complex object, where instantiating all of it would be multiple lines of set-up.
I see this occurring often when employing snapshot testing. Changing the defaults of the object creation changes the snapshot.
