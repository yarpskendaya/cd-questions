# When/Act Questions

(Original question)
Do you make a habit to extract the calling of the SUT into the DSL in order to write tests where you only provide the calling parameters you deem interesting in the context of the test?

## Re-use of tests at different levels
Based on what services were injected into the test, test could theoretically be run in-memory ór with actual production versions. Are tests re-used like that often?
